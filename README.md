# Overview

As an aspiring full-stack developer I need to familiarize myself with multiple different backend languages and tools, with Java being one of the more popular ones. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiencies in the fundamentals of Java. 

This project is a basic implementation of a game program, which has the user play two different games. Those games are currently a number guessing game and hangman. Both of those games are contained within in their own classes and are called/used within a separate program class, which serves as the entry point for the program. When the program is run the user gets to play hangman first, with the other game coming right after. Each game allows the user to play as many times as they would like before moving on to the next game. Once both games have been completed the program thanks the user for playing and terminates. All of this is run in the terminal/console. 

I decided to do this project and learn Java because the only backend languages I knew prior to this were Python, C#, and some SQL. Java remains one of the most popular languages used in the industry today, and to be marketable I needed to challenge myself to learn this language and break out of the comfort zone I have with C#. Learning Java now enables me to pursue learning Kotlin and developing apps for the Android mobile platform, with those projects also being available for employers to review on my GitHub once they are completed.

# Future Work

- Learn more about the "scanner" in Java and how I could use it to better implement a menu for the user to make choices from. Implement said feature.
- Learn how to clear the console using Java as it does not have a built-in "clear()" function, then implement it for better console readability.
- Add more games to the program, such as tic-tac-toe.
- Refactor the game classes to inherit from a single parent game class (inheritance).
- Learn how to create GUIs for Java programs and implement a GUI for this game program.
